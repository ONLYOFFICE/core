% xlatmap - the map of translation tables for various kinds of fonts.
%
% It specifies Decoding resources to be used with FAPI-handled fonts.
% If a font contains multiple character mapping tables, this gives 
% priorities for choosing a specific table from the font according to
% the order of entries of this map.

% This file is intended to be customized by users. Please keep the 
% obvious format of this file. Strings and names must not be empty
% and must not contain null ('\0') characters.

% The map contains entries for each kind of font being handled by
% any font rendering plugin. The key of an entry is the font type
% and the value is array of pairs.
% The first element of pair is a string which encodes identifier of
% character mapping table. The format of the first element depends
% on the font type, and should be recognized by the font rendering 
% plugins. The second element is name of the Decoding resource. If 
% that resource is not available, definefont will fail. Note that 
% currently we supply insufficient decoding resources, as well as 
% insufficient entries in this map.
