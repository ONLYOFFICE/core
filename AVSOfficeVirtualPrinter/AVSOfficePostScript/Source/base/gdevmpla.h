 * Planar memory devices store the bits by planes instead of by chunks.
 * The plane corresponding to the least significant bits of the color index
 * is stored first.  Each plane may store a different number of bits,
 * but the depth of each plane must be an allowable one for a memory
 * device and not greater than 16 (currently, 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16), and the
 * total must not exceed the size of gx_color_index.
 *
 * Planar devices store the data for each plane contiguously, as though
 * each plane were a separate device.  There is an array of line pointers
 * for each plane (num_planes arrays in all).
 */

/*
 * Set up a planar memory device, after calling gs_make_mem_device but
 * before opening the device.  The pre-existing device provides the color
 * mapping procedures, but not the drawing procedures.  Requires: num_planes
 * > 0, plane_depths[0 ..  num_planes - 1] > 0, sum of plane_depths <=
 * mdev->color_info.depth.
