.SH NAME
pdfopt \- Ghostscript PDF Optimizer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpdfopt\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIinput.pdf output.pdf\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpdfopt\fR uses \fBgs\fR(1) to convert the Adobe \fBPortable Document
Format\fR (PDF) file "input.pdf" to a so-called optimized form in
"output.pdf".  Optimization puts the elements of the file into a more linear
order and adds "hint" pointers, allowing Adobe's Acrobat(TM) products to
display individual pages of the file more quickly when accessing the file
through a network.
.PP
Note: input.pdf and output.pdf must not be the same.  If they are, the file
will probably be destroyed.  \fBpdfopt\fR currently does not check for this.
.SH FILES
Run "\fBgs -h\fR" to find the location of Ghostscript documentation on your
system, from which you can get more details.
