### Crypto++ Issue Report

Thanks for taking the time to report an issue. Reporting issues helps us improve stability and reliability for all users, so it is a valuable contribution.

Please do not ask questions in the bug tracker. Please ask questions on the Crypto++ Users List at http://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cryptopp-users.

Please do not ask questions about unsupported build systems, like Autotools, CMake, Conan and NuGet. They are other people's projects. We don't know anything about them.

Please do not ask questions at Stack Overflow. We do not patrol Stack Overflow. We will not be able to answer your question.

There is a wiki page with information on filing useful bug reports. If you have some time please visit http://www.cryptopp.com/wiki/Bug_Report on the wiki. The executive summary is:
