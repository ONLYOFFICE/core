    /**
     * Attention!!!
     * If you use the builder as an application and a script, then you need to know some limitations.
     *
     * 1) docbuilder.exe "path-to-script.docbuilder"
     * This this is the same as
     * NSDoctRenderer::CDocBuilder::Initialize();
     * CDocBuilder builder;
     * builder.Run("path-to-script.docbuilder");
     * NSDoctRenderer::CDocBuilder::Dispose();
     *
     * 2) argument
     * docbuilder.exe "--argument={\"company\":\"ONLYOFFICE\",\"product\":\"ONLYOFFICE Document Builder\"}" "path-to-script.docbuilder"
     * This set the --argument property to CDocBuilder & Run (see point 1)
     * Using in javascript:
     * var sCompany   = Argument["company"];
     * var sProduct = Argument["product"];
     *
     * 3) Methods of the "builder" object cannot be called with values - js variables. If necessary, then you need to
     * wrap it in an instruction "jsValue", e.g.:
     * var jsVar = "123.docx";
     * builder.SaveFile("docx", jsVar); // ERROR
     * builder.SaveFile("docx", jsValue(jsVar)); // GOOD
     *
     * 4) For convenience, format types have been replaced with strings
     * builder.CreateFile("docx");
     * This this is the same as CDocBuilder.CreateFile(AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_DOCX);
     * builder.SaveFile("docx", file_path);
     * This this is the same as CDocBuilder.SaveFile("docx", file_path);
     *
     * All names:
     * "docx": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_DOCX;
     * "doc": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_DOC;
     * "odt": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_ODT;
     * "rtf": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_RTF;
     * "txt": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_TXT;
     * "pptx": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_PRESENTATION_PPTX;
     * "odp": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_PRESENTATION_ODP;
     * "xlsx": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_SPREADSHEET_XLSX;
     * "xls": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_SPREADSHEET_XLS;
     * "ods": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_SPREADSHEET_ODS;
     * "csv": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_SPREADSHEET_CSV;
     * "pdf": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_CROSSPLATFORM_PDF;
     * "image": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_IMAGE;
     * "jpg": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_IMAGE;
     * "png": AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_IMAGE;
     *
     * 5) All javascript context present wrapper over native CDocBuilder object: builderJS.
     * You need to work with it as with an ordinary javascript object. The jsValue instruction is not needed.
     *
     * builderJS methods:
     * builderJS.OpenFile("path_or_url", "x2t_additons_as_xml");
     * builderJS.CreateFile(AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_DOCX);
     * builderJS.SetTmpFolder("folder");
     * builderJS.SaveFile(AVS_OFFICESTUDIO_FILE_DOCUMENT_DOCX, "path", "x2t_additons_as_xml");
     * builderJS.CloseFile();
     *
     * Attention: The rule under point 4 does not work for the builderJS object
     *
     * 6) The builder always works with one file.
     * But there are times when you need to be able to open another file, not for adding to the content,
     * but for some manipulations (comparing, mailmerge). For such cases, the builder provides a method OpenTmpFile
     *
     * var tmpFile = builderJS.OpenTmpFile("path_or_url");
     *
     * interface of tmpFile:
     * IsValid() : return boolean value
     * GetBinary() : return Uint8Array with doct/pptt/xlst binary content
     * GetFolder() : return string path to the tmp folder with tmp file content
     * Close() : close file (remove content of the tmp folder)
     * GetImageMap() : return object-dictionary with key-value imageId -> imagePath (for inserting to document)
     *
